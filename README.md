I'm a formerly incarcerated software developer based in Stockton, California. I am currently making a transtion from driving semi-trucks all day to tech.

I build, maintain and design web applications. I've been coding professionally since 2022 with a focus on frontend technologies. I am also a mentee in [Underdog Devs](https://www.underdogdevs.org).
